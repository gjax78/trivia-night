# Trivia Night
  Want to host a trivia night but don't know where to start? Trivia Night is here!
  With Trivia Night a user will land on the page and see a series of trivia categories. From there the user will see a list of trivia questions for that category. They can then add and remove questions to their game page to create their own customized list of trivia questions!
